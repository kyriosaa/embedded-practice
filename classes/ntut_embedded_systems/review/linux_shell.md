##
**1. What is Linux?**

> Linux is a Unix clone written from scratch by Linus Torvalds with assistance from a team of hackers across the Internet.

##
**2. What is Unix?**

> Unix is a multitasking, multi-user operating system developed in 1969 at Bell Labs.

##
**3. What is an "xterm" emulation software?**

> A software that emulates an "X" terminal and connects using the "SSH" Secure Shell Protocol.

##
**4. What is a shell?**

> A computer program that interprets the commands you type and sends them to the operating system. Secondly, it provides a programming environment consisting of different environment variables.

##
**5. What is the command to find out the shell your computer uses?**

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

##
**6. What does the pipe "|" symbol do?**

> It feels the OUTPUT of one command into the INPUT of another command.

##
**7. Why do we use shell scripting?**

> - Prepare input files, monitor jobs, process outputs
> - Useful to create own commands
> - Save time in file processing
> - Automate tasks such as system administration

##
**8. Write "Hello World!", the current date, and the current directory in the terminal using shell.**

```bash
echo Hello World!
echo The date today is `date`
echo The current directory is $directory
```

##
**9. What does "#!" mean at the top of a shell script?**

> Indicates the location of the shell that will be run to execute the script

##
**10. Explain the three different types of quote characters.**

> Double Quote (")
> - If a string is enclosed in "", the references to variables ($variable) are replaced by their values. Back-quote and escape (\) characters are treated specially.

> Single Quote (')
> - Everything inside is taken literally and nothing is treated as special.

> Back Quote (`)
> - Everything inside is treated as a command and the shell will attempt to execute it. If the execution is successful, the primary output from the command replaces the string.

##
**11. In the above example, if there are less than 3 items in the response, what will the trailing variables be set to?**

```bash
echo "Please enter three file names:"
read filea fileb filec
echo "These files are used: $filea $fileb $filec"
```

> blank ('')

##
**12. In a shell script, what type of variable will 'a' be?**

```bash
