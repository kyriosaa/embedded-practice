--------------------------------------
QoS 0 (At most once)

QoS 0 operates by just having the publisher send out the data to the broker once
without caring if the broker actually received the message or not. It's quick and
not resource intensive but risks the messages being lost if a network interruption
was to occur. Good for data where some loss is acceptable such as sensor data.

--------------------------------------
QoS 1 (At least once)

Qos 1 operates by waiting for the broker to return a PUBACK. If it doesn't receive
one, it retries sending the message. If more messages are sent during this time, the
messages are all lined up in a queue and sent when a network connection gets
re-established. It's a little slower than Qos 0 because we need to wait for a return
handshake. Good for alerts or control commands where we can't risk losing data such
as a security alarm or an important function command in a machine.

--------------------------------------
QoS 2 (Exactly once)

Qos 2 uses a 4-step handshake method to make sure that the message is received exactly
once. This is to make sure there is no data loss or duplicate data. This method has 
the most network overhead and latency.

(PUBLISH -> PUBREC -> PUBREL -> PUBCOMP)

This is good for systems that can not risk duplicate messages such as financial
transactions or counting applications.

--------------------------------------
Based on our investigation, we believe that...

QoS 0 is best suited for real-time environmental monitoring because lost messages are 
easily ignored if real-time data is sent every couple seconds.

QoS 2 is best for critical alert notifications because we need to make sure the alert
is actually sent but a duplicate message doesn't change the outcome of the system.
